# HTML Text Formatting Examples

This is a **bold (b)** example and right next to it we have a **strong emphasis (strong)** .

Notice that

**strong + bold mixed** looks similar but carries additional semantic meaning.

Here is an *italic (i)* word and an *emphasis (em)* example.

Sometimes we combine them like

*italic + emphasis together* .

Now let's look at text that appears crossed out: ~~strikethrough with s~~ and ~~deleted with del~~ .

You can also mix them:

~~double strikethrough (s + del)~~ .

To highlight insertions or underlines: underlined with u , inserted with ins .

A combination could be:

underline + insertion together .

Subscript and superscript examples:

Water is written as H

2 O using sub.

The mathematical expression x

2 + y 3 uses sup.

They can also be combined: CO

2 * .

Mixing several: This sentence has ***strong + emphasis*** ,

some

**bold + underline** , and a formula like a 2 + b 3 .
