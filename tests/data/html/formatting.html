  <h1>HTML Text Formatting Examples</h1>

  <p>
    This is a <b>bold (b)</b> example and right next to it we have a 
    <strong>strong emphasis (strong)</strong>.  
    Notice that <strong><b>strong + bold mixed</b></strong> looks similar but carries additional semantic meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an <i>italic (i)</i> word and an <em>emphasis (em)</em> example.  
    Sometimes we combine them like <i><em>italic + emphasis together</em></i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let's look at text that appears crossed out:  
    <s>strikethrough with s</s> and 
    <del>deleted with del</del>.  
    You can also mix them: <s><del>double strikethrough (s + del)</del></s>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To highlight insertions or underlines:  
    <u>underlined with u</u>,  
    <ins>inserted with ins</ins>.  
    A combination could be: <u><ins>underline + insertion together</ins></u>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Subscript and superscript examples:  
    Water is written as H<sub>2</sub>O using sub.  
    The mathematical expression x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> uses sup.  
    They can also be combined: CO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mixing several: This sentence has <strong><em>strong + emphasis</em></strong>,  
    some <b><u>bold + underline</u></b>, and a formula like a<sup>2</sup> + b<sub>3</sub>.
  </p>
