The first assessments recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) are sentinel and spot-check sites—referred to as pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS)—in each implementation unit after MDA.

Secondary data analysis was completed using existing data from Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Haiti, Indonesia, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda.

Bivariate analysis and multilinear regression were performed to establish potential relationships between variables and the pre-TAS result.

Variables statistically significantly associated with failure (p-value ≤0.05) in the bivariate analyses included baseline prevalence at or above 5% or 10%, use of Filariasis Test Strips (FTS), primary vector of Culex, treatment with diethylcarbamazine-albendazole, higher elevation, higher population density, higher enhanced vegetation index (EVI), higher annual rainfall, and 6 or more rounds of MDA. This paper reports for the first time factors associated with pre-TAS results from a multi-country analysis.

To eliminate LF as a public health problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends two strategies: reducing transmission through annual mass drug administration (MDA) and reducing suffering through ensuring the availability of morbidity management and disability prevention services to all patients [1]. For the first strategy, eliminating LF as a public health problem is defined as a ‘reduction in measurable prevalence in infection in endemic areas below a target threshold at which further transmission is considered unlikely even in the absence of MDA’ [2].

      "orig": "The road to elimination as a public health problem has several milestones. First, where LF prevalence at baseline has exceeded 1% as measured either through microfilaremia (Mf) or antigenemia (Ag), MDA is implemented and treatment coverage is measured in all implementation units, which usually correspond to districts. Implementation units must complete at least five rounds of ‘effective’ treatment, i.e. treatment with a minimum coverage of 65% of the total population. Then, WHO recommends sentinel and spot-check site assessments—referred to as pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS)—in each implementation unit to determine whether prevalence in each site is less than 1% Mf or less than 2% Ag [4]. Next, if these thresholds are met, national programs can progress to the first transmission assessment survey (TAS). The TAS is a population-based cluster or systematic survey of six- and seven-year-old children to assess whether transmission has fallen below the threshold at which infection is believed to persist. TAS is conducted at least three times, with two years between each survey. TAS 1 results determine if it is appropriate to stop MDA or whether further rounds are required.

      "text": "The road to elimination as a public health problem has several milestones. First, where LF prevalence at baseline has exceeded 1% as measured either through microfilaremia (Mf) or antigenemia (Ag), MDA is implemented and treatment coverage is measured in all implementation units, which usually correspond to districts. Implementation units must complete at least five rounds of ‘effective’ treatment, i.e. treatment with a minimum coverage of 65% of the total population. Then, WHO recommends sentinel and spot-check site assessments—referred to as pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS)—in each implementation unit to determine whether prevalence in each site is less than 1% Mf or less than 2% Ag [4]. Next, if these thresholds are met, national programs can progress to the first transmission assessment survey (TAS). The TAS is a population-based cluster or systematic survey of six- and seven-year-old children to assess whether transmission has fallen below the threshold at which infection is believed to persist.
